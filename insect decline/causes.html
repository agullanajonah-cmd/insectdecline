      <h2>Causes of Insect Decline</h2>
      <p>The causes of this insect decline have been attributed to human actions and to associated climate and global ecological changes (Gordon et al, 2019, as cited in Dirzo et al., 2014; Hallmann et al., 2017; Lister & Garcia, 2018).</p>
      <p><strong>Human activities that have made impact on the population decline of insects: (Saravia, 2025)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pesticide Use</strong> – The widespread use of pesticides, specifically neonicotinoids, have had severe repercussions on insect populations. Neonicotinoids are systemic insecticides that contaminate entire plants, including pollen and nectar, important food sources for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</li>
        <li><strong>Habitat Loss</strong> – Expanding agriculture, deforestation, and urban development have removed ecosystems that once supported various insect populations.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate Change</strong> – Climate change has altered environmental conditions, making it difficult for many insect species to adapt to these changes. Rising temperatures, shifts in rainfall patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events disrupt insect life cycles, migration patterns, and the availability of food sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Light Pollution</strong> – Light pollution disorients nocturnal insects like beetles and moths, interfering with their navigation, reproduction, and predation avoidance.</li>
      </ul>
