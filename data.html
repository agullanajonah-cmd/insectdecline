      <h2>The Data: How Bad Is the Crisis?</h2>
      <p><strong>The statistics make the urgency of this crisis clear:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Saravia (2025)</strong> stated that many insect species rely on specific host plants or microhabitats such as leaf litter, rotting wood, or undisturbed soil that are eliminated when land is cleared or modified. Monocultures and manicured landscapes also reduce the availability of nectar sources, shelter, and breeding sites, making it difficult for insects to survive.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>According to the <strong>United Nations (2019)</strong>, across the world, more than <strong>40 per cent of insect species are declining</strong> and a third are endangered.</li>
        <li>The rate of extinction is <strong>eight times faster</strong> than that of mammals, birds and reptiles.</li>
        <li>The total mass of insects is falling by a precipitous <strong>2.5 per cent a year</strong>, according to the best data available, suggesting they could vanish within a century.</li>
        <li><strong>Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera)</strong> are the taxa (groups of organisms) most affected; four aquatic taxa are imperiled and have already lost a large proportion of species.</li>
      </ul>

        “The world’s insects are hurtling down the path to extinction, threatening a catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems,” says UN Environment biodiversity expert Marieta Sakalian. “We urgently need to take action on many fronts to stem this decline.”

      <h3>What the Numbers Tell Us</h3>
      <p>This proves that there is evidence that insect decline is happening around us and it’s fast and quick. The data indicates that insect decline in this ecosystem has been hurting our environment without us noticing it with our eyes.</p>
      <p>If more than 40% of insect species are already declining, and a third are endangered, the question is not whether we will see consequences, but how soon and how severe those consequences will be?</p>
      <p>These data gathered by the United Nations should not be taken for granted. The whole ecosystem is at risk if we do not take action. These data trends that were presented here signals that there will be risks including food security, human health, and environmental stability. We, the people, should act now before everything is too late for us.</p>
