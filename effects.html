      <h2>Effects of Insect Decline</h2>
      <h3>Loss of Endemic Species</h3>
      <p>The extinction of endemic species‚Äîthose unique to specific regions‚Äîposes a critical threat to already fragile ecosystems. For example, the highlands of Cameroon along the Cameroon Volcanic Line host many endemic insect species. Their disappearance undermines the stability of this ecologically unique area (Gordon et al., 2019; as cited in Bergl et al., 2007).</p>
      <h3>Loss of Ecosystem Services</h3>
      <h4>Why This Matters to Humans and the Planet</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pollination is at risk:</strong> According to Saravia (2025) one of their most important roles is pollination, which is primarily carried out by bees, butterflies, beetles, and flies. As around 75% of flowering plants and nearly 35% of global crop production rely on insect pollination, losing them would have catastrophic repercussions on both wild plant reproduction and food systems, impacting natural biodiversity, human nutrition, and agricultural economies.</li>
        <li><strong>Disrupted Food Webs:</strong> The food web is an important aspect in the ecosystem and without it functioning normally due to the decline of population on the insects, many creatures are at risk behind this environmental problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Drive decomposition and nutrient cycling:</strong> Species such as beetles, flies, and ants help break down dead organisms, waste, and plant matter, returning nutrients to the soil and maintaining ecosystem health. Without their activity, organic material would accumulate, slowing down the natural recycling of nutrients and in turn weaken plant growth and lead to instability within food webs (Saravia, 2025).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This only proves that even as tiny as insects they play an important role in our ecosystem that contributes to the way of life.</p>
